# Case Background

Tuango is a “deal-of-the-day” website in China, similar to Groupon, offering discounted gift certificates for local or national retailers. The name "Tuango" sounds like "group buying" in Chinese, reflecting the collective purchasing model.

Tuango's mobile campaigns typically involve selecting customers interested in a deal's category, ensuring they live close to the promoted store if applicable, and pushing the offer through the mobile app. However, we are questioning the assumption that sending offer messages is cost-free, recognizing the risk of customers blocking messages if they received too many irrelevant offers.

Our goal is a build a targeting model based on a customer's profile and spending habits, in order to accurately determine who we should be targeting. 

The deal we are evaluating is a 30-minute karaoke session offered by a large karaoke chain. The deal was priced at 49 RMB per 30-minute session, and up to a dozen such sessions could be purchased. Tuango’s fee was 50% of the  deal price when a deal was sold to consumers (similar to Groupon in the US). Similar deals had  already been successful in other cities, particularly with middle-aged customers and those that had purchased music related deals.

We've received the dataset of customers who were offered the deal and the results.

Below describes the variables in the dataset:
